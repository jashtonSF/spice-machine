###"spice machine web control v1.0"
This html file is designed to control a stepper motor connected to a Particle Photon through the sketch "web-stepper.ino" in the fimrware folder.

Simply load the html file in any browser, adjust the number of steps and/or the delay (which controls motor rotational speed), and click the button "dispense" to begin rotating the stepper motor as specified. There is a serial port opened for monitoring.

**Note:** Before using, please update the html file with your unique Photon ID and token access. It is designed for local browser use, so hosting this html file on a website with your Photon keys will make them available to anyone.
